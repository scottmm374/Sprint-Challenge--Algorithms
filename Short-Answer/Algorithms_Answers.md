#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) But its also Infinite, unless Unless n is a negative number or 0 this will run forever because (a) will always be less then (n)
IF n were negative then its constant time 0(1), simple execution that does not change because of the input.

b) O(log n) Logarithmic. The reason why is because j advances \*2 indicies every run through which actually causes the time the loop runs to get much smaller with each loop compared to the input.

c) O(1) BUT it runs forever with a positive integer since it adds 1 everytime- It never stops.
